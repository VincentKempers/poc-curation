You can start the VueJS by starting up a node enviroment and installing the CLI `npm install vue-cli`. You can test out and use VueJS via an package in your html by adding  `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>`. But to have more control install vue via `npm` and use the `vue-cli` and vue packages.

`Data: {}` is the object that can store data. The data can store variables and functions that is directly and immediatly accessible.
