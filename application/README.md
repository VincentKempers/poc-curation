# The Webplatform for De Nieuwe Boekhandel


## Why VueJS? (IMO)

It's a more logical code space then a React. It's lighter and easier. For this specific project.
React can be really heavy and possibly a mess. Because this site needs to be light and needs to work with easily changed with updates.
If somebody else looks at this code he will understand the method easier than learning .JSX

## How does this work

This application is a progressive web app (PWA). It will mimic a look and feel for the local bookstore "De Nieuwe Boekhandel".
It supports key features like:
- Curation
- Who is in the store (right now)
- And a hub where you immediatly can see if they are open or not.
